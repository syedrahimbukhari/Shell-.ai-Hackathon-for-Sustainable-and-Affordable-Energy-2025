# üèÜ Ultimate Hybrid Model - Shell AI Hackathon 2025

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Ultimate Hybrid Model developed for the Shell AI Hackathon 2025 ‚Äì Fuel Blend Properties Prediction Challenge. The model predicts 10 final blend properties from complex component fractions and properties using a hybrid approach combining Gradient Boosting and XGBoost.

## Features
- **Hybrid Modeling:** Gradient Boosting for stable targets, XGBoost for complex patterns.  
- **Target-Specific Feature Engineering:** Captures interactions, outlier handling, and statistical robustness.  
- **Prediction Pipeline:** Data preprocessing, feature recreation, smart prediction, and fallback mechanisms.  
- **Production-Ready:** Robust error handling, feature persistence, and reproducible configurations.  
- **Deliverables:** Submission-ready CSV/Numpy predictions, feature sets, and trained model files.  

## Model Details
- **Gradient Boosting:** n_estimators=100-300, learning_rate=0.05-0.15, max_depth=3-4  
- **XGBoost:** n_estimators=100-500, learning_rate=0.01-0.2, max_depth=3-7, regularization alpha=0-1, lambda=1-3  
- **Targets:** 10 blend properties (BlendProperty1 to BlendProperty10)  
- **Feature Engineering:** 56 raw features expanded to 74 with target-specific features  

## Usage
1. Load the test dataset (`test.csv`).  
2. Execute the prediction pipeline (`predict.py` or notebook).  
3. Output: `hybrid_predictions.csv` ready for competition submission.  

## Deliverables
- `hybrid_predictions.csv` - Main competition submission  
- `hybrid_predictions.npy` - Backup predictions  
- `feature_sets.pkl` - Feature configuration  
- `ultimate_hybrid_model.pkl` - Primary trained model  
- `smart_hybrid_model.pkl` & `xgb_hybrid_model.pkl` - Alternative hybrid variants
